            <text>Investigation of the obelisk has revealed some information. It is an archotechnological device that seems to interact with organic creatures at a distance. It is probably a piece of a much larger archotech structure that was destroyed or broken apart long ago. The machinery at its core is inhumanly complex and frighteningly powerful. Its purpose and method of action remain totally mysterious.\n\nIf not suppressed, its activity level will increase over time. You can't tell what will happen when the device fully activates.</text>

            <text>You've learned more about the obelisk. It is an archotech machine that manipulates psychic powers. The device can create psy-waves and control minds.\n\nThe obelisk's energy level rises unless suppressed. If it fully activates, it could create powerful psy-pulse, warping minds of all living creatures in the region.\n\n{PAWN_nameDef} thinks that it may be possible to safely shut down the obelisk but this will need significantly more study.\n\nYou can now intentionally provoke a response from the crannied obelisk.</text>
